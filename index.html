            <h1>Hello World in 5 languages</h1>
            <p>This document demonstrates "Hello World" applications in some of the most popular languages as of <time datetime="2020-07">July 2020</time>, according to the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE index</a>.</p>
            <section id="lang-cpp" class="main-section">
                <header>C(++)</header>
                <p>C, and its extension, C++, are in tandem with each other the most popular languages in recent history.</p>
                <p>C allows for a complex vocabulary, but doesn't enforce it by introducing verbosity like Java does. How little you can get away with may confuse developers coming from other languages, that make a high level of abstraction part of their design.</p>
                <p>This is an example of a Hello World application in C:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
#include &ltstdio.h&gt
int main() {
    // printf() displays the string inside quotation
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </section>
            <section id="lang-java" class="main-section">
                <header>Java</header>
                <p>For decades, Java is going head-to-head with C(++). Its rich ecosystem provides many opportunities for developers to latch on.</p>
                <p>Java code is much more verbose than C(++) code and the compiler enforces this verbosity rigorously. This leads to some critique from experienced developers who wish for the support of a more rapid development style. Beginners, however, are met with very clear expectations.</p>
                <p>This is an example of a Hello World application in Java:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
                    </code>

            <section id="lang-swift" class="main-section">
                <header>Swift</header>
                <p>Swift is a programming language for Apple devices and Linux. It is relatively young, being first released in 2014.</p>
                <p>In comparison to C(++), Swift provides a less steep learning curve. An active community and a large variety of tools makes it one of the most successful languages of the past decade.</p>
                <p>This is an example of a Hello World application in Swift:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
import Swift
print("Hello, World!")
                    </code>

            <section id="lang-vb" class="main-section">
                <header>Visual Basic</header>
                <p>Visual Basic (.NET) is the spiritual successor of the proprietary Microsoft Visual Basic programming language which was no longer being supported after the release of the .NET platform.</p>
                <p>Many want it dead but the demand for developers is still steady and VB.NET isn't going to disappear anytime soon. Its importance in legacy systems is undeniable.</p>
                <p>This is an example of a Hello World application in Visual Basic (.NET):</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
Imports System
Module Hello_Program
    Sub Main()
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!")
        Console.ReadKey()
    End Sub
End Module
                    </code>

                <header>R</header>
                <p>The R programming language is designed for statistical computing and a de-facto standard due to its active development for more than two decades.</p>
                <p>R has recently seen a significant surge in activity. The language rose from rank 20 in <time datetime="2019">2019</time> to rank 8 in <time datetime="2020">2020</time>.</p>
                <p>This is an example of a Hello World application in R:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
cat("Hello World\n")
                    </code>
